Overview
One of the biggest stars to come out of the 1970s era of Marvel continues his Epic Collection journey - the Spirit of Vengeance, Ghost Rider!
 
 In his second Epic Collection, Ghost Rider faces a myriad of adversaries â€” from the awesome Orb and the Gladiator, to the Eel and the Enforcer! The Rider travels across the Americaâ€™s backroads and the supernatural worlds beyond. They will bring him into the realm of the mystical Dr. Druid and into a team-up with Hawkeye and Two-Gun Kid against the fearsome Manticore! And with Karen Page in Ghost Riderâ€™s cast, Daredevil enters the fray in a crossover classic drawn by John Byrne! Also featuring the fearsome joining of Ghost Rider, Man-Thing, Morbius and Werewolf by Night as the Legion of Monsters!
