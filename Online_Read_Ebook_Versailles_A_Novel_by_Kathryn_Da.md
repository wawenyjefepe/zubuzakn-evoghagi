Marie Antoinette ‚Äútells her own story‚Äù in this ‚Äúsage, mercurial, and ravishing‚Äù novel (The New Yorker)

 Versailles tells the story of an expansive spirit locked in a pretty body and an impossible moment in history. As the novel begins, fourteen-year-old Marie Antoinette is traveling from Austria to France to meet her fianc√©. He will become the sixteenth Louis to rule France, and Antoinette will be his queen‚Äîthough neither shows a strong inclination toward power, politics, or the roles they have been summoned to play. Antoinette finds herself hemmed in by towering hairdos, the xenophobic suspicion of her subjects, the misogyny of her detractors, and the labyrinthine twists and turns of the palace she calls home.
 
 At once witty, entertaining, and astonishingly wise, this widely acclaimed novel is an enchanting meditation on girlhood, womanhood, architecture, and‚Äîabove all‚Äîtime and the soul‚Äôs true journey within it. Shaken free of the dust of history and calcified myth, Antoinette is ‚Äúvery much alive here, and she‚Äôs magnificent‚Äù (Stacey D‚ÄôErasmo, The New York Times Book Review).
