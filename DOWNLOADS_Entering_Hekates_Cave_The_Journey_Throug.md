An in-depth spiritual journey through the truths and traumas of one’s past to a rebirth and renewal of personal wholeness. To the ancients, the goddess Hekate symbolized the inner journey back to the soul. Indeed, ancient philosophers identified her as Anima Mundi, the “soul of the world.” As such, she connects many archetypes associated with the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. From her role as protector of roadways to her power as the bringer of death, she offers us keys for healing. Incorporating her personal experiences with those of her students, Cyndi Brannen weaves a supporting circle around the reader as they start their path towards soulful living, culminating in rebirth. Blending symbolism, transcendent experiences, dreams, and natural magic with sound psychological theories and practices, Entering Hekate’s Cave guides the reader safely through the journey back to the soul.
