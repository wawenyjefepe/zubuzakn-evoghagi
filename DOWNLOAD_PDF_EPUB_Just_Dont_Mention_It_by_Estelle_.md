Can love heal all wounds? At seventeen, Tyler Bruce is hot â€” a hot mess. His girlfriend is a knockout, his reputation&amp;#039;s untouchable, parties are nothing without him. Even his car is unreal. But inside Tyler is broken â€” and he&amp;#039;ll stop at nothing to keep that a secret. Then one summer Eden comes to stay. She&amp;#039;s upfront, sharp and far more enticing than a stepsister should be. She also sees straight through Tyler&amp;#039;s bad boy faÃ§ade to the vulnerable kid within. The quiet kid who took all the punches. As Eden draws Tyler in, his defenses start to crumble around him. In his past, vulnerability only brought him danger. But now, it might just bring him everything he needs...if it doesn&amp;#039;t break him. As irresistible and dazzling as its Californian backdrop, Just Don&amp;#039;t Mention It is a companion novel to the Did I Mention I Miss You trilogy that explores Tyler&amp;#039;s story â€” his heart-stopping tale of past hurt, finding hope and figuring out who the hell he wants to be.
