An irresistible blend of history, suspense, and romance, SUSANNAH MORROW captures the extraordinary drama of the Salem witch trials.
 
 The hysteria and deceit that gripped Salem, Massachusetts, and ended the lives of 24 men and women in 1692 has been the basis of many works of fiction. Now, Megan Chance combines high drama, sweeping romance, and historical accuracy to offer a fresh perspective on the Salem witch trials. At the heart of SUSANNAH MORROW are the accused, the accuser, and the man who loves them both, and each becomes a tragic victim of the time. At 15, Charity Fowler has lost too much: her mother in childbirth and her illusions about romance to a young man who broke her heart. Her father, a devout Christian, has withdrawn from the family, and her aunt, Susannah, who has moved to Salem from London, is struggling to find her place in a family, and a community, that are threatened by her obvious sensuality. It quickly becomes clear that Susannah has chosen the wrong time to enter this society, as religious fervor, repressed emotions, and sexual guilt are about to explode into a form of hysteria that will condemn her as a victim in one of the most gruesome chapters of American history.
