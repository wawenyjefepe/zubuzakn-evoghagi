All the Tools You Need to Study God&amp;#039;s Word

 The Bible wasn&amp;#039;t meant to be studied only by pastors or biblical scholars—it&amp;#039;s for everyone! But despite being the bestselling book of all time, God&amp;#039;s Word can sometimes be intimidating for the rest of us.
 
 Drawing from fifty years in ministry, Dr. Jack Graham inspires you to dive deeper into Scripture on your own in order to grow in your connection with God. This guide will help you
 
 · understand the overall narrative of the Bible
 · develop meaningful devotional practices
 · sidestep common mistakes in Bible interpretation
 · apply Scripture to your everyday life and more.
 
 Whether you&amp;#039;re a seasoned believer or just beginning your spiritual journey, The Jesus Book provides everything you need to unlock the timeless wisdom and transformative power of God&amp;#039;s Word.
