Winona never anticipated for love to cross her path. But a stolen kiss one evening and meeting a stranger the next thrusts her into a heart&#039;s turmoil: choosing between a steadfast journalist offering stability and Weston, a mysterious wagon master who has made her head spin for the last several months on the Oregon Trail. Scarred by the trials of life, Weston has always sworn off love. But finding himself drawn to Winona, he starts to see that perhaps it was wrong of him to guard his heart and vow never to love. Just when he&#039;s ready to give his feelings a chance, a stranger steps in, proposing marriage to Winona and wrecking all Weston&#039;s plans. Amidst the wild beauty of the frontier, Winona and Weston&#039;s emotions clash, leading to choices that could change the course of their lives.

Enjoy the clean, historical wagon train series! Four orphans and their headmistress set out for Oregon in search of men looking for mail-order brides. Will they find what they are looking for?
